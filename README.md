# File Encryptor/Decryptor üõ°Ô∏è

This C++ program is a simple file encryption and decryption tool that uses the XOR encryption algorithm. It allows you to encrypt or decrypt files with a user-provided key. The XOR encryption method is a basic but useful way of securing files in scenarios where strong encryption is not required.

## Features üåü

- Encrypt and decrypt files with a password-based key.
- Command-line interface to provide the operation (encrypt/decrypt), input file, output file, and key.
- Simple XOR encryption/decryption method.

## Usage üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
- The program works on any system with standard I/O libraries.

### Compilation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-encryptor.git
   cd file-encryptor
